### Pagerank and Laplacian analysis for the graph in Neo4j 

The graph in Neo4j is analysed using Networkx [Link](https://gitlab.scai.fraunhofer.de/ndv/research/automotive/cae_nlp/-/tree/ganesh/Link%20analysis%20and%20pagerank%20using%20Networkx)

This is a serial execution file (continous execution). This requires pickle file BabelNet graph where the graph is saved.
